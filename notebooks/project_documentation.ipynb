    "## 1. Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates how common study-related factors correlate with an overall **Performance Index** using a synthetic dataset of 10,000 students. The goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow for multiple linear regression (and optional alternatives) while following best practices in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points  \n",
    "- **Synthetic data**: Relationships uncovered here are illustrative, not prescriptive.  \n",
    "- **Target**: *Performance Index* (integer 10 – 100, higher = better).  \n",
    "- **Predictors**: Study hours, prior scores, extracurricular participation, sleep hours, practice papers.\n",

    "| Previous Scores | Numeric | Score in prior test (%) | 40 – 99 |\n",
    "| Extracurricular Activities | Categorical | **Yes/No** participation | – |\n",
    "| Sleep Hours | Numeric | Average sleep per day (hours) | 4 – 9 |\n",

    "## 3. Notebook Roadmap  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup**  \n",
    "   - Import NumPy, pandas, seaborn/matplotlib, scikit-learn.  \n",
    "   - Configure plot aesthetics & random seeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Loading & Inspection**  \n",
    "   - Load the CSV.  \n",
    "   - Display shape, `head()`, `info()`, summary stats, and missing-value counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  \n",
    "   - *Univariate*: Histograms/KDEs; bar chart for extracurriculars.  \n",
    "   - *Bivariate*: Scatterplots of each predictor vs. **Performance Index** with regression lines; boxplot for extracurricular comparison.  \n",
    "   - *Correlation Matrix*: Pearson coefficients + heatmap to spot multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Preparation**  \n",
    "   - Encode `Extracurricular Activities` (Yes → 1, No → 0).  \n",
    "   - Optionally scale features (e.g., `StandardScaler`).  \n",
    "   - Train/test split (e.g., 80/20).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Modeling**  \n",
    "   - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Fit OLS model, show coefficients.  \n",
    "   - **Metrics**: R², MAE, RMSE on both splits; plot predicted vs. actual.  \n",
    "   - **Diagnostics** (optional): Residuals vs. fitted, Q-Q plot, VIF for multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Feature Importance & Interpretation**  \n",
    "   - Discuss sign and magnitude of coefficients.  \n",
    "   - Relate findings to plausible academic behaviors (with the synthetic caveat).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Model Enhancement (Optional)**  \n",
    "   - Regularization: Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet.  \n",
    "   - Tree-based or ensemble regressors for non-linear relationships.  \n",
    "   - Cross-validation for robust hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Conclusions**  \n",
    "   - Summarize insights, model performance, and next steps (e.g., testing on real data).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Appendix**  \n",
    "   - Helper functions, plotting utilities, reproducibility notes (library versions, seeds).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Usage Notes  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **License**: Dataset is free to share and adapt; cite the Kaggle source when distributing derivative work.  \n",
    "- **Educational Focus**: Use this notebook to practice feature engineering, regression modeling, and critical evaluation of synthetic results before tackling real-world datasets.\n"
