    "\n",
    "The **Aircraft Sensor and Engine Performance** dataset, collected by Aadharsh Viswanath, consists of detailed aviation sensor data recording **engine performance metrics and operational settings** from commercial jet engines over multiple flights. This dataset is well-suited for predictive maintenance, reliability analysis, and multivariate regression tasks, making it an excellent resource for demonstrating **multi-factor (multivariate) gradient descent** in machine learning.\n",

    "- **Source:** Real-world aviation engine monitoring data (public, open-source).\n",
    "- **Format:** CSV (comma-separated values), readily usable with `pandas`.\n",
    "- **Observations:** Each row represents a snapshot (flight cycle or time interval) of a specific engine's operation.\n",
    "- **Features:** Multiple continuous variables, including sensor readings and operational parameters.\n",
